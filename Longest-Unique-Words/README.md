# Longest-Unique-Words

Write a function that accepts a list of strings that represent words and a positive interger "n", representing the number of words to return. Your function should return a new list containing the "n" longest unique words from the input list. Words are unique if they only appear one time in the input list.
PS - there's always exactly "n" words to return and you may return the words in any order.
